# testing for INSERT
# problems tested: inserting duplicate tuple, inserting with too many args, inserting with too few args,
# inserting to catalog, inserting to a relation that does not exist, inserting with no arguments,
# inserting with only a relation name, inserting with redundant quotes, inserting with wrong type,
# inserting with argument length greater than allowed
